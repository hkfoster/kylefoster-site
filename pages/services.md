## Consultancy

I provide remote design and/or front-end development consultancy for companies and teams of all sizes. Need help starting a new project? Let me help set it up. Struggling to find a direction? Let’s work it out.

Consultancy work typically occurs toward the beginning of a project: I come in, speak with the business to learn about what your requirements are, then work with your team to satisfy those requirements.

Clients will often open a retainer after this initial engagement, so I can periodically review progress or assist with roadblocks. Consultancy engagements are specific to the client and project, so it’s best to open a discussion as early as possible to work out exactly what you need.
