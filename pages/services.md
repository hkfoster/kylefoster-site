## Consultancy

I provide remote or on-site consultancy for companies and teams of all sizes. Need help starting a new project? Let me help set it up. Struggling to work out why pages feel so slow? Let’s work it out.

Consultancy work normally—although certainly not always—happens toward the beginning of a project: I come in, speak with the business to learn about what your requirements are, then work with designers and developers to architect solutions that satisfy those requirements.

After this initial engagement, clients will commonly open a retainer, so that I can be called in periodically to either review progress, or assist with tricky or troublesome roadblocks.

Consultancy engagements are usually very specific to the client and project, so it’s always best to open a discussion as early as possible to work out exactly what you need, and how much of it.

## Design only

Consultancy work often involves some development work on my part (proofs of concept, initial architecture, sprint-zero work, etc.), but most of the time is spent discussing and planning.

If you’d like me to provide more long-term and more involved development work, that is something that I am open to discussing for the right team and the right product.
