Howdy! I’m a digital designer, developer, and creative leader based in Chicago, Illinois. For over a decade I’ve helped companies create intuitive and attractive digital experiences that solve problems and exceed business objectives. During my career I’ve worked solo, collaboratively, and helped build creative teams from the ground up. Most recently, I’ve specialized in establishing brands and delivering products in the startup space. If you have a project and would like to chat about working together, <a class="underline" href="/services/">hit me up</a>.
