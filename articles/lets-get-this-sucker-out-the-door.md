Oh hi there! If you’re reading this, you probably know me personally or are a search bot. Welcome humans and robots alike. I’ve been tinkering around on the design of this site for a good while now, and I’ve spent enough time bikeshedding. Time to pull the trigger and be embarassed with my MVP of a blog.

The notion that anything we can create is “perfect” is something that’s pushed back projects of mine for years, and it’s my goal in the upcoming year to just produce, publish, and iterate. That’s the only way this thing is going to work.

So yeah, hopefully you’ll stick around for some decent-to-middling content about web design and development – the stuff I’ve been plugging away at for a decade now. The least I can provide is perspective.

Cheers to a happy and productive New Year! 🍻
